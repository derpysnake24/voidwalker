        <h1> The Act and Work of Creation: 
        </h1>
        <p>  My favorite question to ask has always been "Why?" I found it very easy to annoy by just endlessly asking "why" until I inevitably got the response: "Because that's the way it is." Deeper than my love of annoying people I love, I loved actually *knowing* why. It was comforting to know the why behind something; but usually in my unending quest to ask why, after everyone else had left, I would turn to inward and ask "Why am *I*?" [What is my purpose meme]. And I have yet to find a satisfactory answer, which I noticed other people couldn't find either. Not just people I knew, but also dead guys who wrote books that a lot of people still read today despite their lack of an answer. But also living people who made youtube videos (sometimes videos about dead guys and their books) that people still watched despite their lack of an answer. No one had such knowledge, it seemed. One group I discovered early one were the Existentialists: a particularly famous group of dead guys who wrote books about such questions. Camus condemned us to continually search for meaning like Sisyphus, never quite making it to the top, while Sartre similarly cursed us to lead meaningless lives, full stop. Nietzsche told us that "if we had a why to live, we could bear any how", but conveniently obscured how he recommended finding that why within some pretty difficult reads, if such a recommendation exists at all. Religious leaders have done a good job of answering these questions for a lot of people, even with its noted decline in the post-war era. I would boil Jesus' teaching to "love thy neighbor", which I find pretty agreeable in theory, but the average Christian's practice has been lacking. Other religions held to certain sacred rituals and worship of deities to find meaning. One religion/group of dead guys I found particularly intriguing was Buddhism, whose prophet preached a kind of "letting go", in what I've heard described as a kind of "anti-religion". Life is meaningless suffering, but there is a way to detach from life and escape. Means for this "escape" include meditation, shaving your head, fasting, celibacy, and in some traditions, the creation of mandalas.

        <p> Mandalas blew my fucking mind when I first discovered them. It was in a youtube video like the one above. The painstaking time to collect the materials and to make the actual mandala, the level of detail and artistic skill to visualize the mandala in your head and create it using grains of fucking sand. The beauty of the finished product. But more mind-blowing than all of that put together was how they were just DESTROYED after being created. To put all that effort into something, to make something so beautiful, and to just throw it all away: it made no sense to me. I was always taught to build things that last, that every little action builds upon the next into a grand work of art called life. Failing was ok, but purposely just destroying your work? I had never seen anything like it.
        </p>
        <p>Why? Why do this? To me, it is a meditative practice on change, on impermanence, on death. This is a key concept taken from my readings on Buddhism (mainly a bunch of Wikipedia pages) that could go by a couple different names. All things pass, nothing stays the same. To cling to something, to become attached to something: it is not only foolish, but in itself leads to suffering. This may just be Master Yoda talking, but the mandala highlights this perfectly. Becoming attached to your art, your creation, makes no sense. It will destroyed like everything else in the universe: you, me, everyone you know and love, the earth itself, the sun, the whole universe will go dark in an eventual heat death. The Buddha didn't know this of course, but we can resonate with his ideas even more now because of what we've learned from cosmic microwaves. While Buddhists might not agree with this, I view it more as a love of the game than winning. The mandala is about the journey, the act of creation, not the destination, the work of creation.
        </p>
        <p>What work of art doesn't have this characteristic though? How many works have been created and destroyed over the centuries? Even the oldest cave paintings will be destroyed one day, buried under the earth. And this could further be expanded to other types of "works", like businesses or empires, or even a family and your children. They all fall apart eventually. Children, especially, highlight this nature: I view having children as an attempt to become immortal, to leave a legacy that will persist long after you are gone, a genetic legacy that will continue into the eons, given of course that they also have children ad infinitum. There's certainly no guarantee of that latter point, and the amount of "you" that makes up the next generations becomes negligible after 4 or 5, but even the whole human race will be extinguished one day. We might evolve into a completely different species if we make it far enough. But then the earth has to be swallowed up the sun, no? Well then we'll take to the stars. But even those other stars will swallow up the new planets we find. Even if we find a way to survive off the energy from all the black holes that will be left over after every star has gone out, those black holes too will run out of energy after the eons, leaving us with nothing but the pure Void after Entropy has reaped it all. This is the most probable fate given our current understanding of physics, at least for the physical, extensive mode of the universe; it's far more difficult to know what will happen to the more thoughtful, spiritual side of it, but if they are two parts of a larger whole, we should expect the same outcome. 
        </p>
        <p>The act of creating the mandala is the same as flipping a big middle finger to the paragraph above. It's not disagreeing with it: as I said, a core concept of Buddhism is impermanence of the world (along with suffering and the non-self), it just doesn't seem to give a shit about it. If Entropy is going to get it one day anyway, why not destroy it ourselves and not give it the satisfaction?
        </p>
        <p>So why do people still create things to last? It's not that people need to be more enlightened with Buddhist thought: deep down, everyone knows everything here is just passing through. Aside from laziness, the most common trait I notice in people is stubbornness (that might just be my family though). In a certain sense were in all Buddhists, united in the fact that we don't care if its all set to be demolished one day, we'll build it to last for as long as we can anyway 'cause fuck entropy. But it's important to examine where this stubborn pride has come from: human nature is just a scapegoat of an answer (although it might not necessarily be false). A more interesting culprit might be a long term cultural psyop. Looking back at ancient epic poetry, specifically one's that influenced modern Western lines of thought, the Iliad is easily the most influential. The line I remember most from the epic was where Achilles laments his two fates: one where he can return home to live the long peaceful life back home in Greece, his name never to be sung about; or to live the short, violent life where he dies on the battlefield in Troy, but lives forever in the songs. We all know which one he chose given that we still know his name, and how he met his end, but as I said, he cant be sung about forever. While anti-war interpretations of the Iliad do exist, I find it hard to see it as anything but pro-war given the choice Achilles makes. They justify his deeds through his memory in songs and monuments, as modern States justify wars today. Real figures like Alexander the Great were incredibly motivated by Achilles, and he in turn inspired figures like Julius Caesar and Napoleon, all tyrants in their own right who no doubt further inspired the Hitlers and Stalins of our era. Not to mention all the other works of fiction that were inspired by the Iliad to propagate a "live forever through your deeds"-type narrative for billions of other people who lived and died just the same. Who built things to last just the same. Even a modern epic I love falls victim to this. While Luke throwing the lightsaber away at the end of Episode VI literally promotes "letting go", and Anakin's fall to the dark side is no model for how a good person should lead their life, the reason so many people fell in love with the films was *because* of the action and violence in the film; it is called Star WARS after all. Although with deeper examination Star Wars could promote a Buddhist outlook on creation (and maybe the Iliad could too, I'm just not an expert on that one), at the surface level both inspire the use of violence for the creation of a "lasting" legacy.
        </p>
        <p>However, another source of the psyop may be a modern culprit: the techno-capital singularity (TCS). The TCS employs us to create careers, to create lives out of our modern society that implant seamlessly into the creation of itself. We work to feed other workers, or to keep track of the alcohol they consume more efficiently, to help them build more and more efficient processes, to create an artificial intelligence that can seamlessly manage all the resources the world has to offer for its *own* survival, casting us aside when we are no longer needed. The meme illustrates this concept perfectly: that is how each of fits into the TCS, even now. A more positive example could be taken from Isaac Asimov's short story The Last Question: an AI is tasked with finding out how to reverse entropy, how to reverse the heat-death of the universe. It succeeds with all of humanity united with it, but I have trouble differentiating between "uniting" with an AI and with it killing us all off. Asimov believed in believes in a kind of Christian escape from the impermanence (this is made explicit in the story in you read it), while the more enlightened, anonymous memer knows its really just about extending life and time for as longs as is physically possible, regardless of what is created or destroyed in the process: Life for Life's sake. It doesn't care for beauty, it cares for survival, as a conservative caveman might scoff at cave paintings, as our billionaires scoff as art today. It may seem difficult to view the TCS as interested in survival given its wonton destruction of the planet, but a key distinction should be made between it's survival and our survival. The physical planet Earth will exist whether biological life does or not, as a bountiful paradise or nuclear wasteland. In a way, the TCS accepts the nihilism presented earlier, and still flips it the bird, but in a much less (personally) fun way. To put it another way: the TCS is getting rid of change. It seeks pure stability, a universe as determined and predictable as possible. For a real human being though, change is the only constant. Constantly becoming something new. This is not say stability is a bad thing, but unrealistic, even for the TCS. It seeks to bring itself as close to stable as possible, but it can never be perfect. Real art, like the real human, only comes from changing, making something new. The true fun way is to create not to *be* alive, but to *become* beautiful. 
        </p>
        <p>To "make it new" is certainly easier said than done. We're pre-programmed from almost infinite inputs: family, friends, society, culture, etc. All of these have profound effects on how we consume and create art, and it can be very difficult to escape these well-trod paths, consciously or unconsciously. One piece of advice I've heard is that good artists copy, great artists *steal*. Don't just take someone else's work at surface level and add your own flair to it, literally steal it, make it your own work. Copy implies a repeat, steal implies a change. Add the personal touch to confirm new ownership, experiences from your own life, your thoughts and feelings. Steal from places you value as art, even it's popular. Ride waves as needed, but don't end up crashing on shore too hard. The algorithm is very good at directing art waves in a certain direction, but it's always possible to go a different way. This website is an example of that (for now): and old fashioned webpage like in the early days of the internet, no social media, just posts containing some sort of detached content. But the most important thing is to just *start*. Once you begin, with any luck you'll be pulled along by inner momentum into creating more and more. You can never know where it's gonna end up, but that's a good thing. Most importantly, don't worry about the fortune or the fame as an outcome for the art. It's certainly important to be able to feed and house yourself, and if your art can do that, awesome. But once your art becomes attached to an outcome like that, the algorithm begins to take hold of it. As long as you are truly and personally enjoying the creative process, keep doing it. Everyone has something unique to offer the world; even if your on the same wave, no one rides it the same.
        </p>
        <p>Regardless of how to create new are and consume art we enjoy, why do we love art at all, psyop or not? The average person probably doesn't care that much (at least consciously) about whether or not the art lasts. They're no Buddhist, and might actually want to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and maybe let their children enjoy the fruits of their labor too? Nothing wrong with that inherently: something isn't beautiful because it lasts. For most of human history, songs could only be heard once, a fact a lot of us, especially me, have taken for granted. It wasn't about collecting the deepest cuts, but enjoying the live performance of the music in the moment, a reality I have only come to terms with recently. Live music is a very mandalic form of creation AND consumption, all of us knowing we can only experience this as it happens, and then its gone, despite what the people who record concerts on their phone try to capture. Concerts are arguably the oldest form of the creative act: the Iliad itself was originally sung and performed before a live studio audience, full of rhythms and melodies and artistic license and mistakes. Even further back would be birdsongs and mating calls, extending mandalic art into our biological and genetic roots. These probably served a more practical purpose than an artistic one, but as I said,  ancient cave art probably was viewed as a waste of time by our more conservative ancestors too. So its not about it the product, the artwork: its about the creation, the arting.
        </p>
        <p>Personally, the reason I like to create (other than it being fun) is to learn. Concerts taught me a lot about stage presence, how to keep an audience engaged, and riffing with your mistakes. But in many ways creating is more important than consuming. People can learn a lot more from writing than reading, and from playing a sport than from watching it. Of course reading and watching film are extremely important to becoming creatively, but just doing one and not the other leaves you missing a crucial part of the process, like only drinking water but not eating food. You also learn infinitely more about yourself, how you understand and interpret the world, how you are expressed as a part of the world. The imagination, despite its modern connotation, is still a "real" part of the world. It exists, sometimes only in your head, but that is still an expression. Imagination is the only way to push the limits of thought, and imagination is expressed in the creative act. As Deleuze says: "It is up to imagination to reflect passion, to make it resonate and go beyond the limits of its natural partiality and presentness". So its not about making something that lasts into the future, but extending oneself into the future while still being stuck in the present moment in actuality. At first this may appear like creating to last: the difference is, for Deleuze, the imagined art grows beyond it's small corner of the universe, of spacetime, *by* merely being expressed. Creation inherently makes thing last because that's what creation is. Anything created lasts longer, but that's not why we do it. Your passion, your will, *that's* what drives your imaginative expression, and everyone's passion is going to be a little different. The point is to just express it. 
        </p>
        <p>Create. Don't worry about trying to live forever or leaving some legacy, cause its dust to dust anyways. Maybe create a comment or a critique for me (after I find a way to add a comments section). Or maybe share something you created with me.
